Mercury is the smallest planet in the Solar System and the closest to the Sun. Its orbit around the Sun
 takes 87.97 Earth days, the shortest of all the Sun's planets. It is named after the Roman god Mercurius
 (Mercury), god of commerce, messenger of the gods, and mediator between gods and mortals, corresponding to the
 Greek god Hermes (Ἑρμῆς). Like Venus, Mercury orbits the Sun within Earth's orbit as an inferior planet, and its
 apparent distance from the Sun as viewed from Earth never exceeds 28°. This proximity to the Sun means the planet
 can only be seen near the western horizon after sunset or the eastern horizon before sunrise, usually in twilight.
 At this time, it may appear as a bright star-like object, but is more difficult to observe than Venus. <em>click on the picture!</em></p>

Venus is the second planet from the Sun. It is sometimes called Earth's "sister" or "twin" planet as it is almost 
as large and has a similar composition. As an interior planet to Earth, Venus (like Mercury) appears in Earth's sky
 never far from the Sun, either as morning star or evening star. Aside from the Sun and Moon, Venus is the brightest
 natural object in Earth's sky, capable of casting visible shadows on Earth at dark conditions and being visible to the
 naked eye in broad daylight.<em>click on the picture!</em></p>

Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life.
While large volumes of water can be found throughout the Solar System, only Earth sustains liquid surface water.
About 71% of Earth's surface is made up of the ocean, dwarfing Earth's polar ice, lakes, and rivers.
The remaining 29% of Earth's surface is land, consisting of continents and islands.
Earth's surface layer is formed of several slowly moving tectonic plates, interacting to produce mountain ranges, volcanoes,
and earthquakes. Earth's liquid outer core generates the magnetic field that shapes Earth's magnetosphere,
deflecting destructive solar winds.<em>click on the picture!</em></p>

Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System, being larger than only Mercury.
In the English language, Mars is named for the Roman god of war. Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere (less than 1% that of Earth's),
and has a crust primarily composed of elements similar to Earth's crust, as well as a core made of iron and nickel. Mars has surface features such as
impact craters, valleys, dunes, and polar ice caps. It has two small and irregularly shaped moons: Phobos and Deimos.<em>click on the picture!</em></p>

Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. It is a gas giant with a mass more than two and a half times that of all
 the other planets in the Solar System combined, but slightly less than one-thousandth the mass of the Sun. Jupiter is the third brightest natural object 
 in the Earth's night sky after the Moon and Venus, and it has been observed since prehistoric times. It was named after the Roman god Jupiter, the king
 of the gods.<em>click on the picture!</em></p>

Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the Solar System, after Jupiter. It is a gas giant with an average radius of about nine
 and a half times that of Earth.[23][24] It has only one-eighth the average density of Earth; however, with its larger volume, Saturn is over 95 times more
 massive<em>click on the picture!</em></p>

 <h1 style="color:white;"><span>Uranus Planet</span></h1>

 <p style="font-size:30px;color:white;" ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranus"title="reed more about uranus"><img src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-vfvhfYLZVzU/X5Ry56W6JqI/AAAAAAAAANc/QdnuRgriAaUxnNkgSzG4-zQoC53XIx1jwCLcBGAsYHQ/s540/Uranus.gif"

Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. Its name is a reference to the Greek god of the sky, Uranus (Caelus), who,
 according to Greek mythology, was the great-grandfather of Ares (Mars), grandfather of Zeus (Jupiter) and father of
 Cronus (Saturn). It has the third-largest planetary radius and fourth-largest planetary mass in the Solar System.
 Uranus is similar in composition to Neptune, and both have bulk chemical compositions which differ from that of the
 larger gas giants Jupiter and Saturn. For this reason, scientists often classify Uranus and Neptune as "ice giants" to
 distinguish them from the other giant planets.<em>click on the picture!</em></p>  



 <h1 style="color:white;"><span>Neptune Planet</span></h1>

Neptune is the eighth planet from the Sun and the farthest known solar planet. In the Solar System, it is the fourth-largest planet by diameter, 
the third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant planet. It is 17 times the mass of Earth, and slightly more massive than its near-twin Uranus.
 Neptune is denser and physically smaller than Uranus because its greater mass causes more gravitational compression of its atmosphere. It is
 referred to as one of the solar system's two ice giant planets (the other one being Uranus). Being composed primarily of gases and liquids, it has
 no well-defined "solid surface".<em>click on the picture!</em></p>
